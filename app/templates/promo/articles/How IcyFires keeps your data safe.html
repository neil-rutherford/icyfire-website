    <h1>How does IcyFire keep my data safe?</h1>
    <p>At IcyFire, we care deeply about customer trust and realize that you are entrusting us with a very important tool – your company’s messaging. That’s why we thought we’d talk a little about the three pillars that support IcyFire’s internal security policies, as well as the security policies of our service providers. Let’s begin.</p>
    <h2>IcyFire's encryption at rest</h2>
    <p>When we designed our database, we did so under the assumption that a malicious actor with enough know-how could see its contents. (While this is unlikely, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IMq8yUMP7c">it is not impossible</a>.) We identified pieces of information that, if compromised, would cause irreparable damage to users and domains. Before those pieces of information are stored in our database, they are encrypted or hashed. That way, even if attackers gain access to our systems, they will be unable to access sensitive information without first decrypting it.</p>
    <p>Hashing is a process that turns text into a long, encoded string through a series of cryptographic operations that have no known reverse operation. In other words, hashing is a type of one-way encryption: it is very easy to hash something, but it is very hard to decrypt a hash. (Fun fact: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">Bitcoin mining</a> is hash decryption!)</p>
    <p>At IcyFire, we hash your password before we store it in our database. If you have a user account and would like to see what that looks like, log in to the IcyFire website and visit our <a href="https://icy-fire.com/legal/user/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. Under “User Information”, you should be able to see a hashed version of your password. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
    <p>Encryption is a process used to protect data, but it does have a reverse operation. In other words, encryption uses a password to turn text into gibberish, and someone else can use the same password to turn the gibberish back into text. (If you’re curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkV1KEJGKRA">here’s a video</a> about how End to End Encryption works.)</p>
    <p>At IcyFire, we encrypt your domain’s social media credentials before we store them in our database. This is so that your data can be safely transported between our website and our server, but that data can then be decrypted and used by the server later on when needed.</p>

    <h2>IcyFire’s democratized security model</h2>
    <p>Another way IcyFire protects your data is through our democratized security model. We make our relevant security logs available to domain administrators, allowing them to monitor and escalate issues as necessary. This bottom-up security approach is modeled after the Department of Homeland Security’s “if you see something, say something” initiative, and it allows IcyFire to have more individuals monitoring our product’s security. Our democratized security model also provides unrivaled transparency into the inner workings of our web application, which gives users a sense of ownership and control over their product.</p>
    <p>IcyFire also has a bug bounty program, which is an open invitation to <a href="https://safebreach.com/White-Hat-Hackers">white hat hackers</a> to attempt to break into our system. Just like any public-facing web service, IcyFire recognizes that we will be the target of infiltration attempts. IcyFire also recognizes that, as hard as we try, our code is not perfect and probably has some weak points. By incentivizing “good hacking,” we hope to identify and fix problems before black hat hackers exploit them.</p>

    <h2>Granular permissions</h2>
    <p>When users interact with IcyFire, they have no way of accessing their domain’s social media credentials. This allows domain administrators to compartmentalize their users and only allow them to do what they need to. This model also opens the door to using freelancers for digital marketing, since this feature allows users to contribute without giving them the keys to the kingdom.</p>
    <p>New users have no permissions by default, meaning that the domain administrator must first grant each user permission before they can begin using the platform. This gives the domain admin another layer of fine-tuned control over what happens, allowing them to control each individual’s CRUD capabilities (CRUD stands for <u>C</u>reate, <u>R</u>ead, <u>U</u>pdate, and <u>D</u>elete). Finally, this allows for quick identification and neutralization of malicious threats.</p>

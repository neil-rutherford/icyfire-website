    <h1>About IcyFire Technologies, LLC</h1>
    <br>
    <p><i>Hi there. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about our company and our three guiding principles: “help others”, “what if”, and “do good.”</i></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Help Others</h2>
    <p>IcyFire is a technology company based out of Denver, Colorado. We build simple yet powerful tools that save small businesses money, streamline processes, and facilitate collaboration. Our goal is to empower our clients so they can focus on doing what they do best – making their mark on the world.</p>

    <p>We are enormously proud of the products we create, and we view them as an extension of our values. Here are the principles that are hard-coded into each and every one of IcyFire’s products:</p>

    <h3>Ownership</h3>
    <p>Instead of monthly fees and plans, we charge a flat fee. This is important because it fundamentally changes the dynamic between you and us. Instead of convincing you every month to stay with us and continue your subscription, we can focus on providing genuine value. If we find a really good article by our competition, we can share it with you without being scared that you will switch providers. We can be transparent with you and encourage you to take responsibility for your tool. We can show you how some things work under the hood and encourage your creativity and curiosity. Finally, we will listen to your suggestions and try our best to make them a reality.</p>

    <h3>Improvement</h3>
    <p>We pledge to continuously support and improve our products. The product you buy today will be better a year from now, and you will automatically reap the benefits of that upgrade with no additional cost.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Innovation</h3>
    <p>Your personal feedback is crucial to our innovation process and is what gives us a competitive advantage in the tech industry. We want to hear your opinions about existing products and ideas for new ones, since we can't fix your pain points unless you tell us what they are. Working cooperatively will enable us to better serve your needs.</p>

    <h2>What If</h2>
    <p>These two words are incredibly powerful. "What if" not only allows us to challenge the status quo, it also allows us to begin charting a course into the unknown. It encourages creativity and innovation while discouraging complacency.</p>
    <p>At IcyFire, we embrace "what if." We use it to let our voices be heard. We use it to dream of big things and then make them real. We let it decide our tack and put wind in our sails. And when we don’t like how the table is set, we use "what if" to turn it over.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Do Good</h2>
    <p>Although the world has many problems and corporations are well-equipped to solve them, corporate social responsibility seems to come as an afterthought. This is regrettable, so we thought we’d lead by example. What if social responsibility was built into IcyFire’s business model? What if making a profit was only one of the things we do? What if we could leave communities better than we found them?</p>
    <p>For every after-expense dollar that IcyFire makes, we pledge to split it three different ways. One third will go to "People" projects, or ideas that make our communities more just, equitable, healthy, wealthy, and enriched. Another third will go to "Planet" projects, or ideas that help reduce or reverse environmental degradation. Our last third will go to "Profit" projects, or ideas that will help IcyFire earn more money in the future. We may not be as profitable as our competition, but as the saying goes, success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.</p>

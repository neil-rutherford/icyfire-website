    <h2>On the brink</h2>

    <p>Our deer <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/cwd/index.html">waste away</a> in the forests. The water stinks and <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">the people in Flint</a> are not able to drink. A <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/swine-disease-information/african-swine-fever/seminar/african-swine-fever">terrible plague</a> has been brought on the livestock in the field. There have been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hurricane-laura-storm-surge-could-be-unsurvivable/">floods of Biblical proportions</a>, and the skies have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-wildfires-san-francisco-bay-area-sky-orange-smoke-fire-weather-haze">turned red</a> as wildfires rage. A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">deadly disease</a> has ravaged the land; "there is loud wailing throughout [our nation], worse than there has ever been or ever will be again" (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+11&version=NIV">Exodus 11:6</a>). Why does it feel like the end of the world?</p>

    <p>To the astute believer, it may feel as if we are sinners in the hands of a very angry God. For context, let us turn to the Book of Revelation. When Jesus first appears to John, He addresses the problems that face the seven churches of Asia Minor. Jesus chastises the churches for their apathy, for their immorality, and for their affluence. To the Church in Philadelphia, Jesus acknowledges their struggle against religious persecution and vows to “make [those who are of the synagogue of Satan] come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203&version=NIV">Revelation 3:9</a>). Sound familiar?</p>
    
    <p>Look at modern America. Church attendance is <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/248837/church-membership-down-sharply-past-two-decades.aspx">steadily declining</a>, and has been for decades. Young people in particular are leaving our churches at an alarming rate. <b>Apathy – check.</b></p>

    <p>Christians throughout the country have had to choose between upholding their values and <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/01/01/religious-people-think-democrats-will-strip-our-rights-because-its-true/">keeping their jobs</a>. American society has increasingly <a href="https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2019/12/12/the-new-attack-on-christmas/">turned against traditional Christian values</a>. (Not to mention the <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/9-things-you-should-know-about-modern-satanism/">rise and acceptance</a> of Satanist groups.) <b>Immorality – check.</b></p>

    <p>American companies have gotten so rich that they are <a href="https://tifwe.org/the-christians-role-in-wealth-and-power/">acting unbiblically</a>, pushing others down to raise themselves up. Of course, with great wealth comes great hubris, and <a href="https://www.cdfcapital.org/tithing-generosity/">church funding</a> has also begun to dry up. <b>Affluence – check.</b></p>

    <p>Academics are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Tolerate-Religion-Brian-Leiter/dp/0691153612">openly</a> <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/uclrev/vol79/iss4/3/">questioning</a> whether religion (and your First Amendment rights) should be protected at all. “First is the force, fervor and comprehensiveness of the assault on religion we are experiencing today,” Attorney General William Barr <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-remarks-law-school-and-de-nicola-center-ethics">said recently</a>. “This is not decay, this is organized destruction.” <b>Persecution – check.</b></p>

    <p>Our country mocks Him; no wonder He is angry.</p>

    <p>This begs the question: “In the face of all this adversity, what would victory look like?” How would we stay strong in our faith and keep others spiritually healthy? It boils down to three things.</p>

    <p>First, religious liberties would need to be deregulated. No American should be forced to choose between the tenets of their faith and the dictates of the Federal government.</p>

    <p>Churches would also need their voices back. Free speech should not end at the steps of a cathedral, and we must embrace those who speak freely from the pulpit. Remember, it is families and churches who best know how to create strong and loving communities, not government officials.</p>

    <p>Most importantly, churches would be true lighthouses. Designed to save lives, lighthouses have no other purpose than to provide guidance and bring ships safely home. Churches serve the same purpose. In good times, churches guide the rudderless, the lost, and the hopeless. In bad times, churches stand unwavering, completely unaffected by the raging sea around them. And in this particular tempest, your light needs to be brighter than ever before.</p>

    <h2>The modern lighthouse</h2>

    <p>We are in the midst of the largest communications shift in history. The collective knowledge of humanity is suddenly available at our fingertips, and our attention has been commoditized in what is known as the “<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/attention-economy/">attention economy</a>.” In fact, people are so glued to their devices that there are now <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rewired-the-psychology-technology/201305/phantom-pocket-vibration-syndrome">several</a> <a href="https://www.choc.org/health-topics/screen-time-insomnia/">health conditions</a> <a href="https://spineina.com/blog/all-about-tech-neck/">associated</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603">with</a> <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/negative-effects-of-technology#psychological-effects">excessive</a> <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/youtube-stars-burnout-1.4868500">technology</a> <a href="http://www.digitalresponsibility.org/technology-and-hearing-loss">usage</a>. In this sort of environment, how good is a lighthouse that lights its beacon but once a week?</p>

    <p>To be a modern lighthouse, your church needs to have an active social media presence, and here’s why. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/16/facts-about-americans-and-facebook/">Research</a> shows that around 70% of American adults are active on Facebook, and two of the <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2017/2016-nielsen-social-media-report/">largest demographics</a> are Millennials and Baby Boomers. There are also virtually no barriers to entry. Anyone can create an account on social media, and with some time and effort, you can create as good of content as the mega-church down the road. Finally, the return on investment for social media is much higher than traditional advertising mediums. Running a 30-second ad on television will cost you $7,500, while a targeted ad campaign on Facebook could cost you as little as $75.</p>

    <p>By spreading His message on social media, your lighthouse stands tall for all to see. Our product, IcyFire, is a social media management tool that provides an easy-to-use interface, allowing you to focus on the message instead of the delivery. We help churches be the visible and constant lighthouses they once were.</p>

    <p>IcyFire also ensures that your beacon stays lit 24/7. Our queuing functionality allows you to schedule posts at any time of day. Using our social media insights, you can post when people are most likely to see and engage with your content.</p>

    <p>Finally, IcyFire allows you to stay in control of your costs. Other companies charge variable rates, depending on how much you use the service or how many users you have. We know that church budgets are tight, so IcyFire charges a fixed annual rate. We want you to spread your <mark>light</mark> as far as possible.</p>

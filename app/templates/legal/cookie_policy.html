    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>What is a cookie?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to "remember" you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as "first party cookies"), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website ("third party cookies").</p>
    <p>Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as "web beacons" or "pixels." These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. If you are still curious, you can learn more <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
    <p>We use <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/cookies/session-cookies-used-for.html">session cookies</a>. These are signed cryptographically so that they cannot be modified by anyone except the website administrator. Without this session cookie, you would have to log in every time the page reloads.</p>
    <p>We use cookies for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To help you sign in and sign out of our site.</li>
        <li>To help you navigate the site.</li>
        <li>To personalize web pages for you and enhance your user experience.</li>
        <li>To make sure you don't see other people's data and they don't see yours.</li>
        <li>To study the layout of our website so that we can improve it in the future.</li>
        <li>To protect our site from malicious actors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also use some third party cookies to measure website traffic and inform content creation. We use analytic data from Google Analytics cookies to tell us where traffic is going. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If no one is reading our article on Topic X, we won't write another article on that topic.</li>
        <li>If lots of people are reading our article on Topic Y, we will write another article about that soon.</li>
        <li>If one of our landing pages is getting a lot of traffic, we may adjust our marketing strategy and target that demographic more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also use a cookie to prevent against a certain type of attack called <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a>. This allows us to keep our users safe.</p>
    <br>

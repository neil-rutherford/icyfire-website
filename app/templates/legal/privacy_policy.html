    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction to CCPA</h2>
    <p>In 2018, a regulation was passed in California called the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The intentions of the Act were to provide California residents with the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know what personal data is being collected about them.</li>
        <li>Know whether their personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.</li>
        <li>Say no to the sale of personal data.<li>
        <li>Access their personal data.</li>
        <li>Request a business to delete any personal information about a consumer collected from that consumer.</li>
        <li>Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.<li>
    </ul>
    <p>At IcyFire, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that should not depend on where you live. We will honor the CCPA for all users, even if you do not live in California.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction to GDPR</h2>
    <p>In 2016, a regulation was passed in the European Union called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It was intended to give individuals control over their personal information and encourage businesses to take appropriate steps to safeguard consumer data.</p>
    <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transparency and modalities</li>
        <li>Information and access</li>
        <li>Rectification and erasure</li>
        <li>Right to object against automated decisions</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, we have the following obligations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pseudonymization</li>
        <li>Records of processing activities</li>
        <li>Security of personal data</li>
        <li>Data protection officer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At IcyFire, we believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that should not depend on where you live. We will honor the GDPR for all users, even if you do not live in the European Union.</p>

    <h2>Rectification and erasure</h2>
    <p>The GDPR states that IcyFire must respect several key rules in regard to data processing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency:</b> Personal data must be processed in a lawful and transparent manner, ensuring fairness towards the individuals whose personal data is being processed.</li>
        <li><b>Purpose limitation:</b> There must be specific purposes for processing the data and the company must indicate those purposes to individuals when collecting their personal data. A company can’t simply collect personal data for undefined purposes.</li>
        <li><b>Data minimization:</b> The company must collect and process only the personal data that is necessary to fulfill that purpose.</li>
        <li><b>Accuracy:</b> The company must ensure the personal data is accurate and up-to-date, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, and correct it if not.</li>
        <li><b>Compatibility:</b> The company can’t further use the personal data for other purposes that aren’t compatible with the original purpose.</li>
        <li><b>Storage limitation:</b> The company must ensure that personal data is stored for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.</li>
        <li><b>Integrity and confidentiality:</b> The company must install appropriate technical and organizational safeguards that ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Article 21 of the GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data at any time. An objection may be in relation to all of the personal data we hold about an individual or only to certain information. It may also only relate to a particular purpose we are processing the data for.</p>
    <p>If you would like to request that we stop processing your data and/or delete your data, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:gdpr@icy-fire.com">gdpr@icy-fire.com</a>. In your email, please explain your reasoning and what you guideline(s) you believe have been infringed upon. Please also specify what particular data points you would like us to take action on.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the GDPR, IcyFire reserves the right to refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partially) if we find that it is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We reserve the right to consider each objection on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    <p>If your request is denied, you have the right to an explanation of our decision, the right to make a complaint to a supervisory authority, and the right to seek to enforce this right through a judicial remedy.</p>

    <h2>Pseudonymization</h2>
    <p>Pseudonymization is a process for stored data that transforms personal data in such a way that the resulting data cannot be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information. We achieve this in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Encryption of social media credentials.</li>
        <li>Hashing of passwords.</li>
        <li>Use of SQL foreign keys instead of personal information as identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Records of processing activities</h2>
    <p>According to Article 30 of the GDPR, records of processing activities must be maintained that include purposes of the processing, categories involved, and envisaged time limits. The records must be made available to the supervisory authority on request.</p>
    <p>We achieve this level of transparency on this page by detailing what data is collected and why. We keep user and domain data for as long as an account is active. We keep social media data until it has been posted. We keep sales data indefinitely.</p>

    <h2>Security of personal data</h2>
    <p>Our security system, Sentry, is designed to establish a baseline for each user, monitor unusual behavior, and detect threats in real-time. Our extensive security data collection supports and enables this.</p>
    <p>As stated previously, we collect data that includes timestamps, geolocation data, user reference, endpoints, status codes, and status messages. Using this information, we can infer a great deal and detect intrusions and malicious behavior.</p>
    <p>We will do our best to prevent client data. If there is a breach, we will report it to the relevant authorities and individuals within 72 hours.</p>

    <h2>Data protection officer (DPO)</h2>
    <p>We have appointed an internal DPO that is knowledgable about our data collection practices and security systems. There is no conflict of interest in other roles or interest that our DPO holds. Our DPO and GDPR compliance officer can be reached at <a href="mailto:gdpr@icy-fire.com">gdpr@icy-fire.com</a>.</p>

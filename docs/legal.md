# Legal Documentation Portal

## Purpose

This portal is built for all individuals who interact with the site. It serves to clarify IcyFire's legal relationship with different individuals.

Individuals are grouped into three categories -- users, hackers, and clients. Users are defined as individuals who use the site's functionality, and includes anyone with an IcyFire login. Hackers are defined as individuals who are interested in seeing how the website works at a deep, technological level. Hackers include individuals who are exploring because they are curious, those who want to help, and those who seek to harm our company and our users. Clients are defined as institutions who have paid IcyFire in return for our service.

## User Endpoints

### /legal/user/privacy-policy

The IcyFire Privacy Policy is a statement that discloses all of the ways IcyFire collects, uses, discloses, and manages user data. It also addresses IcyFire's compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), even for users who are not physically located in those geographic regions. If the user is logged in, they are also able to see all of the data that IcyFire has collected about them.

### /legal/user/cookie-policy

The IcyFire Cookie Policy is an addition to the IcyFire Privacy Policy dedicated to cookies. Cookies are able to track user behavior and are therefore a potential privacy risk. Our cookie policy details the purpose of the cookies' installation, names the third parties who install or may install cookies through the website and provides links to said third partiesâ€™ respective privacy policy and possible consent forms.

### /legal/user/terms-of-service

The IcyFire Terms of Service are the legal agreements between IcyFire and an individual who wants to use our service. By continuing to use the service, it is implied that the individual agrees to the terms.

## Hacker Endpoints

### /legal/hacker/vulnerability-disclosure-program

The IcyFire Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) outlines our legal approach to vulnerability disclosure, clarifying what we will and will not prosecute. The VDP accomplishes this by identifying things that are "in-scope", or legal and acceptable, and "out-of-scope", or actions that are illegal and unacceptable, even in a research capacity.

### /legal/hacker/report-vulnerability

This pathway offers a secure channel for researchers to report security issues and vulnerabilities, and includes a framework for intake, triage, and workflows for remediation.

## Client Endpoints

### /legal/client/service-agreement

The IcyFire Service Agreement is a legal contract between IcyFire, the developer of IcyFire Social, and any client who purchases and uses the app. It clarifies each side's responsibilities and obligations, including but not limited to restrictions, confidentiality, and warranty.
